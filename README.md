# scratch-usernames
A dataset of Scratch usernames and account IDs.

There is currently no publicly available dataset (that I know of) that contains both usernames and their numerical account IDs. This is my attempt to create one.

I used a Python script that requests the followers of accounts from the Scratch API. If new usernames are discovered, they are added to the all_users dictionary (the all_users.txt file in this repository) along with the associated ID. The code used to do this is not provided, but there's nothing that special about it worth sharing.

The latest data (which is the one people should use) is currently `all_users_2022-07-18.txt`.
